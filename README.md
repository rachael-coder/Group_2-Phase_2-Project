1. The company should consider producing movies from genres that are highly rated like Shor, Documentary, Game-Show, News, Biography, Music, Hisory, Sport, War and Reality-TV.

2. Since these actors/actresses have been involved in movies with the higher rating, the producer can consider utilising this actors/actress to produce their movies.

3. The studio can consider working with these directors during production of movies since they have a higher rating in films.

4. Action, Animation, and Comedy lead profitability, indicating that family-friendly and high-energy genres generate the highest returns.

Hybrid genres dominate, suggesting that movies combining elements like Adventure, Sci-Fi, and Drama attract wider audiences and greater profits.

Comedy appears multiple times, reinforcing its broad appeal and consistent profitability across different sub-genres.
